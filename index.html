![Me](/assets/about_me/tmklein.jpg)

Hello, my name is Thomas Klein. I am a masterâ€™s research student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) studying Artificial Intelligence (AI). I am from Olean, NY, and attended Jamestown Community College where I majored in Individual Studies. Following this experience, I chose to attend the University at Buffalo, where I received my Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. 


I am currently conducting research at AiPEX Lab under Professor Conrad Tucker, where my primary focus is on Computer Vision. My work entails utilizing video for the physiological measurement of vital signs, specifically, I lead the research in blood pressure estimation. In addition to my research experience in Computer Vision, I also have projects in both Natural Language Processing and Generative AI. I am currently looking for full-time positions for the start of summer 2024. On this page, you can find my contact information as well as a list of some projects I have worked on.
